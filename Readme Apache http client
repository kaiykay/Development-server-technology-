## Features

- Retrieve the local IP address of the device.
- Fetch and display a list of free withdrawal games from a specified API using Apache HttpClient.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Maven (optional, for dependency management)

## Installation

### Using Maven

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/free-withdrawal-games-httpclient.git
   cd free-withdrawal-games-httpclient

2. Add the following dependency to your pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
    <artifactId>httpclient</artifactId>
    <version>4.5.13</version>
</dependency>


3. Compile and run the application:

mvn compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="FreeWithdrawalGamesHttpClient"



Without Maven

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/free-withdrawal-games-httpclient.git
cd free-withdrawal-games-httpclient


2. Download Apache HttpClient JAR files from the Apache HttpClient website and place them in your project directory.


3. Compile the application (make sure to adjust the classpath):

javac -cp ".;path/to/httpclient-4.5.13.jar;path/to/httpcore-4.4.13.jar" FreeWithdrawalGamesHttpClient.java


4. Run the application:

java -cp ".;path/to/httpclient-4.5.13.jar;path/to/httpcore-4.4.13.jar" FreeWithdrawalGamesHttpClient



Usage

Modify the API_URL variable in the FreeWithdrawalGamesHttpClient.java file to point to your actual API endpoint for fetching free withdrawal games.

Compile and run the application as described above.


Code Example

Here’s a snippet of how to use Apache HttpClient to fetch data:

CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.createDefault();

HttpGet httpGet = new HttpGet(API_URL);
HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(httpGet);

if (response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode() == 200) {
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(response.getEntity().getContent()));
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
} else {
    System.err.println("Failed to fetch games: " + response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode());
}
