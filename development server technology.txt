Hereâ€™s a basic guide for setting up a development server, written in plain text:

Development Server Setup Guide

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
   - If you're using Node.js:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - If you're using Python:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. Starting the Development Server:
   - For Node.js (with hot-reloading):
     ```
     npm run dev
     ```
   - For Python (Flask or Django):
     ```
     flask run
     ```
     or
     ```
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

3. Environment Configuration:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root (if needed) to store environment variables:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     DEBUG=true
     DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
     ```

4. Accessing the Server:
   - After running the development server, you can access the application by navigating to:
     ```
     http://localhost:3000
     ```
     or whatever port you have configured.

5. Technology Stack:
   - Frontend: [React/Vue/Angular] (if applicable)
   - Backend: Node.js (Express), Flask, or Django
   - Database: MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
   - Additional Tools: Docker, Redis (if applicable)

6. Debugging:
   - If you encounter issues, check the console for error messages and verify that your environment variables are correctly set.

7. Stopping the Server:
   - To stop the development server, press `CTRL + C` in the terminal.

8. Building for Production:
   - To build the project for production (if needed):
     ```
     npm run build
     ```
   - For Python projects, ensure to package your application appropriately using:
     ```
     python setup.py build
     ```

9. Notes:
   - Ensure you have the correct versions of Node.js or Python installed.
   - Make sure all necessary packages are installed before starting the development server.
   - For database configuration, ensure the database is up and running before testing the backend.
