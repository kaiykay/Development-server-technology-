If you want to license a circuit diagram under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), it’s important to understand how the GPL applies to hardware designs. The GPL is typically used for software, but can be extended to hardware designs and related documentation like circuit diagrams in text format (such as ASCII diagrams or textual descriptions). Here’s how you can do that:

Licensing Circuit Diagrams under GNU GPL

1. GPL for Hardware Designs:

The GNU GPL can be applied to circuit diagrams if you want to ensure that anyone who receives the diagram can:

Use the design for any purpose.

Study the design (understanding how it works).

Modify the design and create derivative works.

Share the design or modified versions under the same license terms.




2. Applying GPL to Circuit Diagrams:

You can treat the circuit diagram like source code. This means if you provide the diagram in a text format (TXT), it must be accompanied by a COPYING or LICENSE file containing the full text of the GNU GPL.

Include a statement at the top of the file that specifies the license, for example:

This circuit diagram is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (or later).
You can freely use, modify, and distribute this design under the terms of the GPL.



3. Why GPL for Circuit Diagrams:

By using the GNU GPL, you’re ensuring that any future versions or derivatives of your design remain free and open. This encourages collaboration and prevents others from taking your open design and making it proprietary.



4. Things to Include:

Along with the text-based circuit diagram, include any related files (like simulation files or bill of materials) that are necessary to understand and use the design. These should also be licensed under GPL.

If you have source code for firmware or other software related to the hardware, that should be licensed under the same terms to keep everything consistent.



5. Distribution and Sharing:

When you share the circuit diagram online (e.g., via GitHub), make sure the GPL license is clearly stated in the repository, and that all files (circuit diagrams, design notes, etc.) are covered under the same license.




Summary

Licensing a circuit diagram in TXT format under the GNU GPL allows others to freely use, modify, and share your design, while ensuring that any derivative works also remain open. Be sure to include a license notice in the diagram file and provide a LICENSE file with the full text of the GNU GPL.
