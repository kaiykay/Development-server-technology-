## Features

- Retrieve the local IP address of the device.
- Fetch and display a list of free withdrawal games from a specified API using OkHttp.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Maven (optional, for dependency management)

## Installation

### Using Maven

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/free-withdrawal-games-okhttp.git
   cd free-withdrawal-games-okhttp

2. Add the following dependency to your pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.squareup.okhttp3</groupId>
    <artifactId>okhttp</artifactId>
    <version>4.10.0</version>
</dependency>


3. Compile and run the application:

mvn compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="FreeWithdrawalGamesOkHttp"



Without Maven

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/free-withdrawal-games-okhttp.git
cd free-withdrawal-games-okhttp


2. Download OkHttp and Okio JAR files from OkHttp releases and place them in your project directory.


3. Compile the application (make sure to adjust the classpath):

javac -cp ".;path/to/okhttp-4.10.0.jar;path/to/okio-3.14.0.jar" FreeWithdrawalGamesOkHttp.java


4. Run the application:

java -cp ".;path/to/okhttp-4.10.0.jar;path/to/okio-3.14.0.jar" FreeWithdrawalGamesOkHttp



Usage

Modify the API_URL variable in the FreeWithdrawalGamesOkHttp.java file to point to your actual API endpoint for fetching free withdrawal games.

Compile and run the application as described above.


Code Example

Hereâ€™s a snippet of how to use OkHttp to fetch data:

OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url(API_URL)
        .build();

client.newCall(request).enqueue(new Callback() {
    @Override
    public void onFailure(Call call, IOException e) {
        System.err.println("Failed to fetch games: " + e.getMessage());
    }

    @Override
    public void onResponse(Call call, Response response) throws IOException {
        if (response.isSuccessful()) {
            String responseBody = response.body().string();
            System.out.println(responseBody);
        } else {
            System.err.println("Unexpected code: " + response.code());
        }
    }
});
