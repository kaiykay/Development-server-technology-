It seems like you're looking for information on using the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) for a backend project. The GNU GPL is a widely used free software license that ensures end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software.

Key Points of the GNU GPL:

1. Copyleft License: If you distribute software under the GNU GPL, you must also provide access to the source code. Any derivative works or software that links to the GPL code must also be licensed under the GPL.


2. Freedom to Use: The software can be used for any purpose without restrictions.


3. Freedom to Share: Users can redistribute the original or modified software, provided the same license accompanies it.


4. Freedom to Modify: Users can modify the software, but they must share their modifications under the same GPL license.



Applying the GNU GPL to a Backend Project

1. Source Code: Your backend project must make its source code publicly available if distributed.


2. Derivatives: Any backend service or software that integrates or modifies your code must also comply with the GNU GPL license.


3. Frontend Separation: If the frontend and backend are separate and not integrated tightly (i.e., through APIs), the frontend could use a different license, though this requires careful handling of the license terms.


4. Open-Source Community: Using the GNU GPL fosters community contributions, as developers can freely use and improve your backend project.



If you need help setting up the license in your project, the simplest way is to include a LICENSE file with the following text, making sure to update placeholders:

<Your Project Name> - <Brief Description>

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

If you're working on your digital document management system (OSDDMS), this could be a great license for your project depending on your goals!
