Android Designer MD

Android Designer MD is a markdown-based design tool for creating Android layouts and UI elements with simple and intuitive markdown syntax. It simplifies Android UI development by providing an easy-to-write format that can be converted into XML layouts for Android projects.

Features

Markdown Syntax: Create Android UI components using markdown.

XML Export: Automatically convert markdown into Android-compatible XML layout files.

Component Library: Includes common Android UI components like buttons, text fields, and image views.

Custom Styles: Easily apply custom styles, themes, and colors through markdown.

Real-time Preview: View your Android UI as you write markdown with real-time rendering.

Lightweight and Fast: Efficient tool for quickly prototyping Android UI/UX.


Getting Started

Prerequisites

Before using Android Designer MD, ensure you have the following:

Android Studio (or another preferred Android development environment)

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

Gradle for building Android projects


Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/android-designer-md.git


2. Open in Android Studio:

Open Android Studio, click on File > Open, and navigate to the cloned project folder.



3. Build the project:

Gradle should automatically sync, but if it doesn't, you can manually sync the project using the Sync Project with Gradle Files button.




Usage

1. Creating Layouts with Markdown

Start by writing your layout in markdown in a .md file. Use the provided markdown syntax to define Android UI components. Here's an example:

# Main Layout

## TextView
- id: text_hello
- text: Hello World
- textSize: 18sp
- textColor: #000000

## Button
- id: button_submit
- text: Submit
- onClick: handleSubmit

2. Converting Markdown to XML

Once you have your markdown file, use the provided tool or command to convert it to an XML layout:

npm run convert --file=layout.md --output=main_activity.xml

3. Integrating with Android Project

After generating the XML file, move it to the appropriate layout folder in your Android project (app/src/main/res/layout).

Example Project

The repository includes an example Android project demonstrating how to use Android Designer MD. You can find the example in the example folder. Open it in Android Studio and explore how markdown is used to generate Android UI layouts.

Exporting Options

You can export your designs as:

XML layout files for Android.

Preview images (using a built-in rendering engine).


To export, use:

npm run export --format=xml --file=your_layout.md
